Also, these numbers are expected to increase if nothing is done. It takes two to stop the numbers arising and therefore, the government and the smokers have to cooperate to make the country smoke-free. The government should control the amount of smokers as the rising numbers could cause lost productivity and an increase in the crime rate. Campaigns should be created and advertisements using the mass media can actually help the smokers realize the disadvantages of smoking. Besides that, smokers should also learn the gruesome facts on smoking. They should also realize that there\u2019s more to life than just smoking and that people near and dear to them could be affected from their habit. Studies have shown that people who have family members who are smokers can actually contract diseases such as cancer and other lung diseases. Moreover, the increase in the number of smokers can actually mean that there would probably be an increase in crime rates as well. Smoking would then lead to other dangerous issues like drugs, prostitution, theft and even murder. Therefore, the government should act immediately to avoid further damage to society. 7 Certain smokers who want to quit can find it hard to do so and this is when the government\u2019s help can come in handy. That is by increasing the age limit for adolescents to smoke, increasing tax on tobacco products to make it a lot more expensive and also to provide support gropus for smokers who wish to quit. In a nutshell, smoking is indeed a problem to the nation and it takes two to work it out. The government and the smokers themselves should work side by side to solve this issue.

Over a billion adults legally smoke tobacco every day. Tobacco is slowing taking a billion people in the world towards doom.

Thus, the health costs are high\u2014for smokers themselves, and for wider community in terms of health care costs and lost productivity. There has been awareness among people from many years, about the ill-effects of smoking and various campaigns run by the government, NGOs and local bodies to encourage people to quit smoking but the result have not been impressive. The solution is to nip the problem in the bud. School authorities and parents should keep a close eye so that children don\u2019t start to smoke because they think it is \u201ccool\u201d. They should be made aware about the harmful effects of smoking. Government could play a vital role too. Smoking should not be high-hand in advertisements and movie commercials which have a huge impact on people. It could levy high taxes on tobacco products to keep people away from its reach. Rules for checking children buying such products should be made stringent. The onus to protect from such products also lie on individuals as will-power always does the trick.

In fact, it's a one by one pixel digital projector. You turn on the wall switch and a giant pixel comes out and paints your room.

If you turn on all the pixels the same color, you still have a light bulb in the usual sense. But if you turn on the pixels different amounts and different colors, then you're kind of projecting information out into the world. And if at the same time that you're doing that, you put a little tiny camera inside the bulb, then not only is information flowing out of the glass, but you're collecting optical information.

Apart from this, world wars were also a result of different national groups.

My answer is no, therefore I feel the consumer should avoid buying these products as due to over packaging we can\u2019t even evaluate the quality of product which is possible while buying unpacked or appropriately packed substances. The cause of this trend is paradoxically profit endowed and entrepreneurs are trapped in a self enforcing circle to present their products in more sophisticated ways to enhance marketing and when they notice that the buyers easily get manipulated by just packing of the material, they start wrapping it in more than required material which, in turn, confuses the consumer, therefore, the purchaser must not spend exorbitant money to buy these goods. As being citizens of this planet we have a paramount accountability for environment so buying these products will only cause more waste, which requires so much funds and efforts to dispose off; and in this century when we are fighting with world hunger, spending a lot of money just on packaging and disposal will cause downfall among famers and small scale industries. A laudable initiative to avoid these goods will amplify this notion among others which will lead to downfall of enterprises who neglect quality of the product for just its external make over; and consumers will be able to receive them directly from small town factories whose products are even more efficient than those who are packed in glitters.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?"),a(),s(37,"p"),c(38,"Marriage before settlement affects millions of people especially young girls from all over the world. As soon as these young girls get married, they become fully engaged in all the domestic burdens, marital responsibilities, real life challenges and raising children while they are still not well educated and are immature themselves. I fully agree that getting into married bond before education or job is not a wise decision. Education and good career enhances a person\u2019s intellectual abilities to make decisions related to personal and social life and make them realize their accountabilities in a descriptive way, and if two people marry while studying they can\u2019t focus their mind on study as well as family responsibilities, it will divert their mind in different directions and lead to failure in study and conflicts with partner resulting in disharmony in both family life and career. Marriage before settlement could be because of any reason, but its effects are very devastating. These effects are pertaining to psychological problems, health implications, freedom captivation, enforced maturity, personal and education development, and coping with marital issues. Above all divorce or separation is the main effect of early marriage. When a girl enters into the institution of marriage, she brings the burden of many responsibilities with herself. In order to have a successful and happy married life, it is imperative for both the partners to be educated and settled. Eventually, as with every marriage there will be stresses and pressures, uneducated partners will be more prone to marriage problems since their individuality has been interrupted. Causes: There is a large similarity that underlies causes of marriage of girls before settlement despite the remarkable differences in societies and communities. Nevertheless, the degree of importance differs according to conditions. The major causes that urge on marriage of girls before settlement and at early age are male dominance, parent\u2019s ignorance, myths about early marriage, pressures from relatives and community and even girls are regarded as burdens on their families, so the families get rid of them by marrying them off early.

Large malls often sell items on exorbitant prices as compared to small shops, however the quality of product is same or relatively poor but the glamour of the item is amplified by decorated packaging in malls which small scale industries can\u2019t afford. Therefore, people often feel themselves of impeccable standards to buy goods from malls rather than small shops or carts. Decrease in financial condition of locals is also due to this trend because local farmers and craftsmen cannot earn appropriately due to decreased sale, on the other hand foreign brands and imported items are gaining large profit and country\u2019s economic state is declining. This always widens the gap between wealthy and less well off because malls are often owned by affluent people. In brief, small shops are crucial to flourish living standards of common inhabitants and these should not be replaced by malls.

The appropriate use of technology by taking the positive effects can bring about great changes in our life styles. By promoting global peace by anti war campaigns can counter the use of weapons.
